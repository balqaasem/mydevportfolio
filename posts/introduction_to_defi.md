## 1. Brief History of DeFi

The history of DeFi can be traced back to the early days of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. While the concept of decentralised finance has gained significant traction in recent years, its foundations were laid by pioneering projects that explored the potential of blockchain for financial applications.

In 2009, the launch of Bitcoin introduced the world to the concept of a decentralised digital currency. Bitcoin revolutionised the financial landscape by enabling peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. This marked the beginning of a new era in which individuals could transact directly with one another, bypassing traditional financial institutions.

The next major development came with the introduction of Ethereum in 2015. Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, programmable contracts that automatically execute predefined actions when specific conditions are met. This innovation opened up new possibilities for creating decentralised applications (dApps) on the blockchain.

One of the earliest DeFi projects to gain attention was MakerDAO, launched on the Ethereum blockchain in 2017. MakerDAO introduced the concept of decentralised stablecoins, with Dai being the first stablecoin to gain significant traction. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency, providing stability and mitigating the volatility commonly associated with cryptocurrencies.

In the same year, decentralised exchanges (DEXs) like EtherDelta emerged, allowing users to trade digital assets directly without the need for intermediaries. DEXs provided a decentralised alternative to centralised exchanges, offering increased security, privacy, and control over funds.

The year 2020 witnessed an explosion of DeFi projects and protocols. The introduction of liquidity mining and yield farming models brought increased attention and participation to the DeFi ecosystem. These models incentivised users to provide liquidity to decentralised exchanges and lending platforms, earning rewards in the form of additional tokens or fees.

Projects like Compound, Aave, and Synthetix gained prominence by offering decentralised lending and borrowing services, enabling users to earn interest on their assets or access loans without traditional credit checks. The composability of DeFi protocols allowed users to combine different platforms and strategies to maximise their returns.

Uniswap, a decentralised exchange protocol built on Ethereum, introduced the concept of automated market making (AMM), revolutionising token swaps. Uniswap's decentralised nature, coupled with its user-friendly interface, contributed to its widespread adoption and became a significant driver for the DeFi ecosystem's growth.

As DeFi gained momentum, the Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols soared, reaching billions of dollars. This surge in activity attracted attention from both retail investors and institutional players, highlighting the potential and disruptive nature of decentralised finance.

## 2. What is DeFi?

DeFi, short for Decentralised Finance, is a term used to describe a financial system built on blockchain technology that operates in a decentralised and permissionless manner. Unlike traditional finance, which relies on centralised intermediaries such as banks, DeFi aims to create a financial ecosystem that is open, transparent, and accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

At its core, DeFi leverages the power of blockchain networks, particularly smart contracts, to enable the execution of financial transactions and the provision of financial services without relying on intermediaries. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with predefined rules and conditions encoded on the blockchain. They automatically execute transactions and ensure the integrity and transparency of the system.

The fundamental principle of DeFi is decentralisation. By eliminating the need for intermediaries, DeFi seeks to democratise financial services, allowing individuals to have full control and ownership of their funds. It enables peer-to-peer transactions, where users can interact directly with each other, lending, borrowing, trading, and investing without the need for traditional financial institutions.

## 3. Glossary

1. Smart Contract: A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Smart contracts operate on the blockchain and automatically execute predefined actions when specific conditions are met.

2. Decentralised Application (dApp): An application built on a blockchain network that operates in a decentralised manner. dApps leverage smart contracts to provide services and interact with users without relying on a central authority.

18. Gas Fees: The fees required to process transactions and execute operations on a blockchain network. Gas fees are paid in the native cryptocurrency of the network and help in protecting the network against DOS attacks.

19. Automated Market Maker (AMM): An algorithmic protocol used in decentralised exchanges (DEXs) to determine the prices and facilitate the trading of digital assets. AMMs use liquidity pools and mathematical formulas to provide liquidity and determine asset prices based on supply and demand.

20. Ethical DeFi (also known as Islamic DeFi): Refers to the consideration of ethical principles and practices within the decentralised finance ecosystem. Refers to the application of ethical principles, practices and compliance with Islamic finance principles within the decentralised finance ecosystem. Ethical or Islamic DeFi aims to create financial products and services that adhere to Islamic principles such as avoiding interest (riba), excessive speculation (gharar), and investments in prohibited industries (haram). It focuses on offering Sharia-compliant solutions that align with the ethical values and requirements of Islamic finance. Ethical or Islamic DeFi seeks to provide financial opportunities while adhering to the principles of fairness, transparency, and social responsibility as outlined by Islamic law. Ethical DeFi focuses on promoting transparency, fairness, and inclusivity while ensuring the protection of user funds and privacy. It encompasses initiatives and protocols that prioritise security audits, responsible lending and borrowing practices, user-centric design, and adherence to regulatory frameworks to build trust and sustainability within the DeFi space. Ethical DeFi aims to foster a more ethical and sustainable financial system that benefits all participants and aligns with broader societal values.

## 4. Fundamentals of DeFi

DeFi, or Decentralised Finance, operates on a set of fundamental principles that underpin its core functionality and distinguish it from traditional financial systems. Understanding the fundamentals of DeFi is essential to grasp the unique features and advantages it offers. Here are the key fundamentals of DeFi:

1. Decentralisation: DeFi is built on decentralised blockchain networks, where transactions, operations, and decision-making are distributed across a network of computers, known as nodes. This decentralised architecture eliminates the need for intermediaries, such as banks or financial institutions, allowing users to transact directly with one another.

2. Open Access: DeFi aims to be inclusive and accessible to anyone with an internet connection. It empowers individuals worldwide to participate in financial activities, irrespective of their geographic location, socioeconomic status, or identity. DeFi protocols are typically open-source, enabling transparency, community collaboration, and innovation.

3. Financial Interoperability: DeFi protocols are designed to be interoperable, meaning they can seamlessly interact and integrate with one another. This interoperability allows users to access a wide range of financial services and applications within the DeFi ecosystem. Users can leverage multiple protocols, swap between assets, and take advantage of different DeFi platforms to suit their specific needs.

4. Programmability and Smart Contracts: DeFi leverages smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with predefined rules and conditions encoded on the blockchain. Smart contracts enable the automation of financial transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries and enabling the execution of complex financial operations. They ensure that transactions are executed reliably and transparently, without the need for manual intervention.

5. Trustless and Permissionless: DeFi operates on a trustless and permissionless basis. Trustlessness means that participants do not need to trust each other explicitly. Instead, they trust the code and protocols that govern the transactions. Permissionlessness means that anyone can participate in DeFi without seeking permission or going through traditional gatekeepers. This openness fosters financial innovation, reduces barriers to entry, and promotes financial freedom.

6. Security and Auditing: Security is a critical aspect of DeFi. While blockchain technology provides inherent security through cryptography and consensus mechanisms, DeFi protocols undergo security audits and peer reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. Auditing helps to ensure the integrity of the code, protect user funds, and enhance the overall security of the ecosystem.

7. Financial Services and Products: DeFi offers a wide range of financial services and products, including lending, borrowing, trading, derivatives, decentralised exchanges, yield farming, and more. These services are often facilitated through decentralised applications (dApps) and protocols built on blockchain networks.

8. User Empowerment and Control: DeFi puts users in control of their financial assets and decision-making. Users retain ownership of their funds, hold private keys to their wallets, and have the freedom to interact with DeFi protocols and applications without relying on intermediaries. This user-centric approach empowers individuals to manage their finances independently.
